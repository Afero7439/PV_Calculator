# PV_Calculator
Calculate PC systems using streamlit
Made with python and streamlit to learn and to also help me do my job easier.
Haven't created a database yet so all equipment is predefined in the specific files. 
This is bad, since I can only add new equipment by changing those files and not from the interface.
I have to use sql to manage my equipment but I would like to have a backup of that database so I won't lose it.

The project helps me to calculate the necessary costs in order to build a PV system. These calculations are made with
costs that are used where I work ,so it might not be the cheapest.

Cya!
